# ðŸ§  Intermediate Programming Exercises

This set of intermediate-level exercises is designed to strengthen your logical thinking and problem-solving skills in JavaScript. These activities build upon the basics and introduce conditional logic, loops, and more elaborate numeric/string operations. While not yet entering advanced topics like object-oriented programming or asynchronous behavior, these challenges provide a solid bridge between beginner and advanced programming levels.

1. ~~**String Length and Uppercase:**~~ Enter a string ending in a period and display its character count. Also, output the string in uppercase.

2. ~~**String Comparison:**~~ Enter two strings and determine if they are equal.

3. ~~**Longest and Shortest String:**~~ Enter two strings and display the longer one first, then the shorter.

4. ~~**String Statistics:**~~ Enter a string ending in a period and report:

- Number of characters

- Number of spaces
- Number of words starting with F, f, M, or m

5. ~~**Words with Three Distinct Vowels:**~~ Read several strings and display words with at least three different vowels.

6. ~~**Palindrome Checker:**~~ Create a program to check whether a word is a palindrome (e.g., RADAR, ANILINA).

7. ~~**Even Number Counter:**~~ Read a series of integers ending with a negative number (do not process it). Count how many are even.

8. ~~**Reverse a String:**~~ Read a string and reverse it.

9. ~~**Word Diamond Pattern:**~~ Read a word (up to 21 characters), If the number of characters is even, delete the last character; and print it in the following pattern:

Input: diamond
Output:
M
AMO
DIAMOND
AMO
M

10. ~~**Anagram Checker:**~~ Determine if one string is an anagram of another, ignoring spaces and punctuation.

11. ~~**Sales Record Analysis:**~~ For 4 vendors, determine who made the highest and lowest sale. End input when the sale amount is zero.

12. ~~**High Salary Counter:**~~ Count how many employees have a salary over $25,000. End input when the employee ID is zero.
