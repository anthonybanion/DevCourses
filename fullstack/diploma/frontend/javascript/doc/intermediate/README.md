# ðŸ§  Intermediate Programming Exercises

This set of intermediate-level exercises is designed to strengthen your logical thinking and problem-solving skills in JavaScript. These activities build upon the basics and introduce conditional logic, loops, and more elaborate numeric/string operations. While not yet entering advanced topics like object-oriented programming or asynchronous behavior, these challenges provide a solid bridge between beginner and advanced programming levels.

1. **String Length and Uppercase:** Enter a string ending in a period and display its character count. Also, output the string in uppercase.

2. **String Comparison:** Enter two strings and determine if they are equal.

3. **Longest and Shortest String:** Enter two strings and display the longer one first, then the shorter.

4. **String Statistics:** Enter a string ending in a period and report:

- Number of characters
- Number of vowels
- Number of spaces
- Number of words starting with F, f, M, or m

5. **Words with Three Distinct Vowels:** Read several strings and display words with at least three different vowels.

6. **Palindrome Checker:** Create a program to check whether a word is a palindrome (e.g., RADAR, ANILINA).

7. **Even Number Counter:** Read a series of integers ending with a negative number (do not process it). Count how many are even.

8. **Reverse a String:** Read a string and reverse it.

9. **Word Diamond Pattern:** Read a word (up to 20 characters) and print it in the following pattern:

Input: HOLA
Output:
H O L A
L O
A L O H

10. **Anagram Checker:** Determine if one string is an anagram of another, ignoring spaces and punctuation.

11. **Sales Record Analysis:** For 4 vendors, determine who made the highest and lowest sale. End input when the sale amount is zero.

12. **High Salary Counter:** Count how many employees have a salary over $25,000. End input when the employee ID is zero.

13. **High Sales Counter:** Count how many employees made sales over 100,000 during the month.

14. **Seniority Filter:** In the MZZ company, count how many vendors have more than 10 years of service.

15. **Sales Totalizer:** Enter prices and quantities for 5 items. Calculate and print the total sales for each and the overall total.

16. **Even Number Count (Duplicate of 7):** Same as exercise 7.

17. **Temperature Analysis:** From daily max and min temps, find:

- Minimum temperature
- Maximum temperature
- Maximum of minimums
- Minimum of maximums (Stop when temp = 99)

18. **Sales Record (Duplicate of 11)**

19. **High Salary Counter (Duplicate of 12)**

20. **Stock Value Calculator:** From COST, QUANTITY pairs, calculate the total stock value of a supermarket.

21. **Asterisk for Evens:** Read integers and display "â€¢â€¢â€¢" beside each even. Stop when the sum is â‰¥ 1000.

22. **Above 100 Counter:** From 50 integers, count how many are greater than 100.

23. **Sum of Pairs:** From 50 ordered pairs (X, Y), sum all X's and all Y's and display the results.

24. **Guess the Word Game:**

- System randomly selects a word
- User guesses letter by letter, max 8 errors
- Each guess scores between 1000 and 10000 points
- Points are added if correct, multiplied by number of occurrences

25. **Character Replacement Function:**

- Accepts a string and two characters

- Replaces all occurrences of the first character with the second

26. **Trim Extra Spaces Procedure:**

- Remove leading spaces

- Replace multiple spaces inside with a single one

- Remove trailing spaces

27. **Whitespace Sequence Remover:** Function to remove all space sequences >1 from a string.

28. **Whitespace Sequence Remover (Array Version):** Same as 27, but modifies a character array in-place, without using auxiliary arrays.

29. **Hangman Game:**

- Player A inputs a word (<30 letters)
- Player B guesses up to K times
- Correct letters revealed; wrong letters shown separately
- Track attempts and remaining chances
- Show final word if B fails

30. **Hangman vs Computer:**

- If one player quits, the computer selects a word
- Use random generation or a predefined word list for the computer
