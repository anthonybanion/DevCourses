# Basic Programming Exercises

This exercise guide is designed to help beginners develop logical thinking and become familiar with the fundamentals of JavaScript. Through simple yet practical problems, the goal is to reinforce essential concepts such as variable declarations, basic arithmetic operations, the use of primitive data types (numbers and strings), and data input/output. As an introductory guide, it does not cover more advanced structures like loops, arrays, or functions; the focus is on building a solid foundation to approach those topics with greater confidence later. Additionally, exercises related to string manipulation will be included, as working with text is fundamental in most real-world programs. This collection aims to be an accessible and useful first step in learning how to think like a programmer.
